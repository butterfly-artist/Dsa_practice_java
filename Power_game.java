// Power Game 
// There are 2 teams, each having N players. There will be N rounds played between the 2 teams. In every round, a player from team A plays against a player from team B.
//  The more powerful player wins the game. Given the strength of the players of both teams, you have to find the maximum number of rounds team A can win.
//   Note that a player cannot play more than 1 round.

// Input Format
// The first line of input contains T - the number of test cases.
//  It's followed by 3T lines. The first line contains the N - the size of the team.
//   The next 2 lines contain N numbers each - the strength of the players of team A and team B respectively.

// Output Format
// For each test case, print the maximum number of rounds team A can win, separated by a new line.

// Constraints
// 1 <= T <= 500
// 1 <= N <= 10000
// 0 <= A[i], B[i] <= 10000

// Example
// Input
// 3
// 4
// 1 5 7 4 
// 3 8 2 10 
// 2
// 2 3 
// 10 5 
// 3
// 3 7 10 
// 5 20 15 

// Output
// 2
// 0
// 1

// Explanation

// Test Case-1
// Player with strength 5 in team A can defeat player with strength 3 in team B.
// Player with strength 7 in team A can defeat player with strength 2 in team B.
